ðŸ‘‹ Hi Everyone,

Hope you're all doing well!

This is a BDD Cucumber-based automation project where I have automated a login scenario for Naukri.com. Currently, the project includes automation for the Home Page and Login Page functionalities.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate:

âœ… How to write and organize a Feature file

âœ… How to implement Step Definitions

âœ… How the Runner class executes the test

âœ… How all these components interact within a BDD Cucumber framework

If you're getting started with BDD + Cucumber + Selenium, this project will give you a hands-on view of building a real-world test case.

I'll continue adding more scenarios and enhancements over time â€” including validations, utilities, data-driven testing, and reporting features and so on.....

Thanks for checking it out!

Best regards,
Vijay Pundir
